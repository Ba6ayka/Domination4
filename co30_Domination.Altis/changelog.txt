- Changed: Increased dynamic "Group" simulation from 1000 to 1400
- Fixed: Mine sidemission 104 was spawning enemy AI far far away (marker moved by accident)
- Changed: Reduced number of spawned enemy AI units slightly, seems 1.96 has some performance issues
- Fixed: Really stupid script error in revive
- Fixed: Script error in air AI script
