4.14

- Fixed: Stupid bug which prevented the creation of the last main target when select targets was activated; this also rendered removing auf db autosave rows; game breaker because the mission did not end at all :/
- Fixed: Points were not added to player score when a player destroyed a barracks building or a mobile HQ at main targets (if SQL database available)
- Changed: Add score to players who revive other players too if database is found and revive lives are infinite
- Changed: Show player message for changing sides in the TT version after intro is over
