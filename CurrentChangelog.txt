4.04

- Changed: Better handling for enemy near MHQ trigger (no more format)
- Changed: Rewrote camp and barracks creation code
- Changed: Camp capture FSMs have now exactly the same code as in 3.99s
- Changed: Removed disableRemoteSensors again
- Changed: Switched waitUntil {sleep xxx;..} to while loops
- Added: New param "With 3D draw icon above wreck repair/ammo point:" (d_with_3Dicon), default is on (1)
- Fixed: While remote AI units on a headless client trigger a EntityKilled eventhandler on a server immediately, the alive status of the killed unit is not updated right away,
		this broke respawn AI groups when they were transfered to headless clients
