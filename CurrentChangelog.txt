- Fixed: In the TT version Viewdistance change slider in the Status Dialog did not work at all
- Changed: Removed UAV and UGV backpacks from Virtual Arsenal
- Fixed: In the TT version messages for capturing camps were gone
- Changed: Server param "Armor at side missions" changed, available is "Normal", Less" and "None" now (d_WithLessArmor_side, 0 = normal, 1 = less, 2 = none)
- Changed: If a player respawns at a MHQ and there is no ammobox dropped or nearby then he respawns with the same weapons and ammo as he/she had when he/she died

- Fixed: Don't play ambient radio chatter for UAVs
- Changed: Boats (d_boat_xx) now use d_fnc_vehirespawn instead of a FSM (check 3.97 changelog for respawn params)
