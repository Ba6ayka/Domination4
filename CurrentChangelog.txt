4.00

Version number up to 4 because of many internal changes to the mission code (especially because of the headless client changes and ammo boxes)
Don't worry, you can still use your 3.99s mission.sqm files :)

ATTENTION: Weferlingen Summer and Winter sqm files have changed

- Fixed: While there was a "Mortar bag packs in Virtual Arsenal yes/no" parameter it was never implemented
- Fixed: Ammo point/ammo load marker was gone
