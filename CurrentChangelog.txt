4.05

- Changed: If d_without_nvg or d_without_vec_ti all optics and headgear which use either NVG or TI will be removed once arsenal or inventory closes (d_without_vec_ti also still turns off vehicle TI)
- Added: Checkbox in StatusDialog to enable/disable automatic viewdistance change at main targets
- Fixed: Enemy vehicle HQ could spawn under the ground
- Fixed: One playable group in the Altis Blufor version was somehow moved outside the map and thus players spawned in the water
- Lots of optimizations
