4.11

- Changed: Increased dynamic "Group" simulation from 1000m to 1400m
- Fixed: Mine sidemission 104 was spawning enemy AI far far away (marker moved by accident)
- Changed: Reduced number of spawned enemy AI units slightly, seems 1.96 has some performance issues
- Fixed: Really stupid script error in revive
- Fixed: Script error in air AI script
- Fixed: d_ranked_a array was not available on the server (in case a server is not using a SQL database table)
- Fixed: Air vehicles para dropping or unloading AI over the main target got deleted way too early
- Fixed: Really stupid error which did not delete AI groups of destroyed vehicles, game breaker
- Fixed: Island patrol groups were spawning too much crew
